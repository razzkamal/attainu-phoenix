I started to learn coding, Because of many reasons:

I want to improve my problem-solving ability. Improve abilities means to struggle for something. 
if some code doesn't work. I have to think more about it and make it work.
Today's world function around the computer and their functions.
I have must knowledge of it and how it designed. I want to be coder so that I can help others.
Coders are in high demand also, so I can earn a pretty amount from it.
